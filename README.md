# McKean-Vlasov-Research-Project
## Introduction

The repository explores stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a focus on McKean-Vlasov equations, providing insights into the collective behaviors of particle ensembles. The research delves into two prominent examples: mean-field equations with jumps, relevant in neuroscience, and absorption models with implications in finance. Throughout the project, complexities of numerical and analytical solutions, including the propagation of chaos phenomenon, are thoroughly investigated. The repository contains code for simulations and a concise PDF article summarizing key findings.

## Project Details

### McKean-Vlasov Equations

McKean-Vlasov equations offer a mathematical framework for modeling collective behaviors of particle ensembles. This research project explores their general form and examines two specific examples: mean-field equations with jumps and absorption models.

#### Mean-Field Equations with Jumps

The first example explores mean-field equations with jumps, particularly relevant in neuroscience. These equations describe the evolution of a system characterized by a state variable, influenced by both deterministic and stochastic factors.

#### Absorption Models in Finance

The second example focuses on absorption models, particularly applicable in finance for representing events such as company bankruptcies. These models feature absorbing states and are essential for assessing financial risks.
